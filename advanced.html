				<p><b>-Aim Gliding-</b></p>
				<p><img src="images/aimglide.PNG" alt="Default excalibur aimglide" class="round"></p>
				<p>Aim gliding can be achieved by holding down the aim key while airborne. This allows you to glide through the air while aiming your weapon. Just about any form of movement can be performed while aim gliding including rolls and sliding. Aim glides should be used in combination with other types of movement to cover large distances or fine tune/correct your in-air movement. It should be noted that aim gliding is similar to wall latching in that it can only be done for a limited amount of time.</p> &nbsp;
				
				<p><b>-Kicks-</b></p> 
				<p><img src="images/kick.PNG" alt="Default excalibur kick" class="round"><p>
				<p>Kicks are performed by pressing the crouch key and attempting to slide while airborne or during an aim glide. Kicks can provide a small amount of forward momentum in-air as well as damaging and knocking down enemies you hit.</p> &nbsp;
				
				<p><b>-Movement Comboing-</b></p>
				<!-- This section lacks an image for the mobile viewport because I feel this concept is hard to convey in a single image.
				     The text alone should be more than enough to describe the concept to someone that's read through the site so far.
					 Flooding this part of the page with 5+ images would not be ideal for someone to have to scroll through on a smaller screen. -->
				<p>Now that you've learned all the elements of Warframe's movement system, it's time to chain it all together. Learning how to use each type of movement together and efficiently is what will make your gameplay smoother, and more importantly, faster.</p>
				<p>A good movement combo to learn is:</p>
				<p><b>Bullet Jump->Double Jump->Roll->Aim Glide->Land into a slide and repeat.</b></p>
				<p>Now we're going to cover the topic of movement resetting. You may have noticed that you can only perform a single roll, double jump, and bullet jump until you touch the ground again. Touching the ground "resets" your movement almost like a status, however this applies to touching walls via wall running and wall latching as well. Using walls to reset your movement can allow you to stay airborne for as long as you please.</p> &nbsp;
				
				<p><b>-Air Casting-</b><p>
				<p><img src="images/aircast.PNG" alt="Default excalibur aircast" class="round"><p>
				<p>Some Warframes have abilities that require them to stand still until the ability is done casting. You can bypass this requirement using movement and casting an ability while in the air. Most abilities will allow you to cast while airborne AND aim gliding. If you have enough height, you will have enough time to cast multiple abilities while aim gliding before touching the ground again.</p>
				<p>You should also experiment with various abilities to see if the abilities themselves can be utilized as a movement tool.</p>
