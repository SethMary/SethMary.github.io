				<p>Welcome to WarframeMovement. This site is designed to help Warframe players better understand the game's movement system and fully master it.</p>
				
				<p>The contents of this site are structured to teach any kind of player with any amount of experience. Wheather you're a brand new player or a seasoned veteran, you'll likely learn something here.</p>
				
				<p>Why create such a site? Warframe's in-game tutorial does a decent job of teaching a player how to navigate an environment but can leave out a few details. Many movement techniques are not entirely explained
				or completely left out leaving a player to learn things by themself. There's also movement techniques developed by other players that could prove useful to new players.</p>
